[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/lucasepe/modgv)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/lucasepe/modgv) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [![Go API Reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-docs-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lucasepe/modgv?tab=doc) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [![Mentioned in Awesome Go](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#package-management)

Converts 'go mod graph' output into [GraphViz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/)'s DOT language.

- takes no options or arguments
- it reads the output generated by ‚Äúgo mod graph‚Äù on stdin
- generates a DOT language and writes to stdout

## Usage:

```bash
go mod graph | modgv | dot -Tpng -o graph.png
```

For each module:
- the node representing the greatest version (i.e., the version chosen by Go's MVS algorithm) is colored green
- other nodes, which aren't in the final build list, are colored grey
