# modgv

Converts 'go mod graph' output into Graphviz's DOT language.

- takes no options or arguments
- it reads the output generated by “go mod graph” on stdin
- generates a DOT language and writes to stdout

## Usage:

```bash
go mod graph | modgv | dot -Tpng -o graph.png
```

For each module:
- the node representing the greatest version (i.e., the version chosen by Go's MVS algorithm) is colored green
- other nodes, which aren't in the final build list, are colored grey

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/lucasepe/modgv/modgv
```

### Install GraphViz dependency

This may take a while, as GraphViz has quite a few dependencies of it's own

#### On Mac

Install graphviz via Homebrew

```zsh
brew install graphviz
```

## Sample output (PNG)

```bash
go mod graph | modgv | dot -Tpng -o graph.png
